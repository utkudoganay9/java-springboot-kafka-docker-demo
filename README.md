# Java Spring Boot Kafka Consumer-Producer Demo ðŸ”„

## Introduction
This repository is a demonstration of a consumer-producer system built with Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, and Docker. It's designed to showcase the seamless integration of these technologies in a microservices architecture.

## Key Features
- **Java & Spring Boot**: Leverage the robustness of Java and the simplicity of Spring Boot for creating microservices.
- **Apache Kafka**: Implement a high-throughput, distributed messaging system with Kafka.
- **Docker**: Containerize your application for easy deployment and scaling.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Ensure you have Docker installed and running.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run `docker-compose up` to start the Kafka broker and the Spring Boot applications.

## Explore the Code
- The `producer` directory contains the code for the Kafka message producer.
- The `consumer` directory holds the code for the Kafka message consumer.
- The `config` folder includes the Docker configurations for setting up the Kafka environment.
